# The final data story
Shorthand Story: https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/discrimination-in-the-US-early-child-care-systems/index.html

My final story discusses the discrimination present in the U.S. Early Child Care Systems. Throughout the story, I analyze how the price of child care is harmful, especially to Black families and women in the labor force. I also discuss why this issue is important for our policy makers and the benefits of taking action. 

# Changes made since Part II

Since the completion of Part II and our 1-minute presentation, I have made significant changes to my Shorthand story based on the feedback I received. After talking through my story, I realized that the flow was not what I had hoped. It felt very choppy and not like one cohesive story. Because of this, I have changed my focus to be primarily on Early Education and Child Care. I decided to look back on one of my memorandums written about U.S. child care policies and incorporate my research and analysis into this presentation. In Part II, I had a section about price, but it was not very interesting or engaging, so I my data visualization and my text to tell more of a story. I also decided to change the segregation section to discuss Women in the Labor Force. This helps build on the same story to develop it to be even deeper. I am still highlighting the discrimination that occurs in the child care system and labor force, but telling the same story. Finally, I added a section about why my audience should take action because the feedback I received made me think that it was not very clear at first. In this new section, I also created two new visualizations to demonstrate this idea. My call to action changed to reflect my new audience and how each level of government should act in response to this problem.

Overall, the feedback I received from each part of this project and in-class critiques and interviews really helped me develop my story. I struggled with scaling my idea down to be more specific and to appeal to one audience, but once I figured it out, it became much easier. Although it has changed pretty significantly since my in-class presentation, I feel much more confident and proud of the work I have completed and the story I have told. I think seeing other people present also helped me realize that I needed to make everything more cohesive as a story, rather than an informational presentation. 

## The audience

Based on the feedback I received from my interviews and the professor's comments on the rubric, I decided to narrow my target audience to be education policy makers at every level of government. By focusing just on education policy makers, it helped me develop my story to be specifically geared to them and adjust how I was approaching the issue and story-telling. This led me to focus only on child care because it is something that my audience can directly impact with specific policies. 


## Final design decisions

Deciding which data to visualize was the most difficult part of this project for me. Because my audience was too broad at first, I ended up making about 20 visualizations that I did not end up using. It was extremely time consuming, but once I landed on my final audience and story, my visualizations were much easier to develop and actually use. For the first line chart, I wanted to show the progress of the increasing price over time, so I used the scrollmation aspect by including images of the line progressing. For the second line chart, I wanted to show the difference of women in the labor force by race, so making both lines appear on the same chart and using two contrasting colors to make it more apparent. Finally, when I was conducting my research and found the predicted difference in population demographics, I knew I wanted to visualize this with two pie charts. I wanted all of the minority races to be shades of orange, while the white population was grey. I chose to represent them this way so it was apparent that the minority populations are predicted to become the majority.

One of the biggest things I learned through my data visualizations process was to not get too tied to using one visual. I was focused on being able to incorporate my map showing segregation rates across the U.S., but it ended up taking away from the overall story and did not make much sense just thrown in at the end. Once I came to this conclusion, I was able to take a step back and realize that it was better to eliminate this visualization and focus on developing the story.

# Final thoughts

I became quite frustrated with myself while doing this project because I felt like I was wasting a lot of time making visualizations that I did not end up using. I wish I had spent more time and effort in the development phases and going into each in-class critique and interview with more fully formed sections. I think the time between each phase was pretty quick so it was difficult to focus on developing my story as much as I wanted to. I am, finally, happy with how my Shorthand has turned out, but I wish I would have reached this point much earlier on and had presented this to the class rather than my previous version.
