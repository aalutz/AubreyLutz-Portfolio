# User Research 

## Target Audience

My target audience for this presentation of data is people who work in school administration. I think it is important for them to understand the segregation and discrimination that occurs in schools and how this affects people later in life. 


## Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|Determine cohesiveness of story and data|Do you find the information and data presented cohesive as one story?|
|Improving Visualizations|How can I improve my visualizations of the data?|
|Cohesiveness of Visuals|What are your thoughts on the colors and images I have incorporated throughout?|
|Organization of Data/Info|Are the key takeaways useful for each section/visualization?|


## Interview Findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 - Female, Student, Mid-20s | Interview 2 - Female, Student, Early 20s|
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Do you find the information and data presented cohesive as one story? |Yes, but I think it would be important to state why diversity is important to get your point across even more.|Yes, I really like the content and data and think it all makes sense together.|
|How can I improve my visualizations of the data?|Maybe try defining the information a bit more either with the legend or directly in the chart.|It would be helpful to know which bars we should really be paying attention to, so maybe try highlighting that in a different way.|
|What are your thoughts on the colors and images I have incorporated throughout?|I like that your first bar chart matches the colors used in the previous image.|I agree, I think it would be nice to incorporate those same colors throughout the rest of your visualizations.|
|Are the key takeaways useful for each section/visualization?|Yes, I think it will help you highlight the main ideas from the visualizations.|Yes, I think it will help you as well when talking about them in your one minute presentation.|


# Identified Changes for Part III

I am going to add a section discussing the benefits of school diversity, clearly identify the types of care in a brief paragraph and also within the chart itself, continue the same color scheme throughout the rest of the presentation and visualizations, and make sure the important data is highlighted.
