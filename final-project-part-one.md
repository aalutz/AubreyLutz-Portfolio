# Outline
 
While _Brown v. Board_ may have resulted in the desegregation of American schools, our educational system continues to be heavily divided by race. One of the main factors contributing to this division is geographical segregation due to economic status and historical redlining. With this project, I hope to highlight the racial divide that is still occuring in the U.S. school system. 

In order to convey this story to my audience, I want to make a comparison between geographical areas, with one being highly segregated and the other being more integrated. In making this comparison, I will also look at how economic status contributes to this division. 

The structure of my story will begin with shocking statistics highlighting the extreme levels of segregation today to gain the audience's attention. I will then explore some of the historical influences that led to these statistics. To make things a bit more positive, I will discuss the vast benefits of early education and the effect it can have on an individual's future. I will then dive into the data analysis, comparing a segregated area with an integrated area and the key differences between the two. By doing so, I will focus on how this impacts minorities long-term when it comes to their careers and economic status. To conclude, I will highlight any progress that has been made in regards to educational segregation and encourage my audience to work with non-profits and advocacy groups that focus on this issue.

# The data
The Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University has a fantastic site with publicly accessible data focused on school segregation by geographical area. I will be using their data to explore correlations and create additional visualizations. I will also use some of their already created visualizations that may help my audience understand the issue in an easier way. 

The Century Foundation also has data available on this topic that will be useful for my storytelling. Halley Porter wrote an article focusing on the key takeaways and it will be helpful in identifying some of the main statistics to incorporate into my own story.

# Method and medium
I intend on using ArcGIS Story Maps to create my final deliverable for this project. To create my data visualizations, I will use Tableau and ArcGIS Pro. I think I will be able to incorporate my story in a way that flows naturally using data visualizations, images, statistics, text, and maps. Because this is a heavy topic, I want to make sure that the information is presented in a way that is easily comprehensible.
