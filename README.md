# Introduction
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU. Feel free to check out my work below!

# About me
Hi! My name is Aubrey Lutz (she/her) and I am a second-year Masters in Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon University's H. John Heinz III College. I earned my Bachelors degree at Duquesne University's Palumbo Donahue School of Business in Management and International Business.

I am passionate about working to improve minority experiences in education and the workplace. I hope to pursue a career in Education Consulting after graduating with Masters degree in May 2025. My passion for education stems from watching my mother pursue her career in teaching. Once my family adopted three African-American siblings, it became glaringly obvious that their educational experience was drastically different from my own. The systemic racism that has been built into our educational systems became apparent and sparked my interest in learning more about the minority experience in education. 


# What I hope to learn
By taking this Data Visualizations course, I hope to learn how to make complex data a bit more comprehensible to the average person. If I can effectively translate mass data into a simplified visualization, I hope the public will be able to understand the impact data can have on a serious topic.
