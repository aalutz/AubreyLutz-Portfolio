# Literacy of People Aged 15+ by Country Income Level
This information presented below is representative of the percentage share of people aged 15+ that are deeemed "literate" based on their country's income level from 2006-2023. The data used was from the World Bank (2024). 

## Step One: The Visualization

Data source: World Bank (2024); van Zanden, J. et al. (2014) 

I selected this data visualization because it was the first one in the article that I was unable to clearly understand just by looking at it. After reading about what the visualization was trying to represent, I was interested in the data and the story they were trying to convey. My initial response to this visualization was a sense of overwhelm from the graph portion itself being completely full from 0-100%. I also did not realize right away that it was an interactive timeline with a scrolling x-axis. I knew I wanted to redesign this visualization because the information and story is important for readers to understand.

## Step Two: The Critique
Overall, I wanted to simplify the level of infomation visualized to make it easier for the readers to understand at first glance. I found the original visualization to be truthful and fairly useful, however, it lacked in aesthetics, intuitiveness, perceptibility and completeness.

## Step Three: Sketch a Solution

## Step Four: Test the Solution

| Question | Interview 1 - Student, mid 20s (MSPPM 2nd Year) |
|Can you describe to me what this is telling you?|It's showing the literacy of people ages 15+ based on the income level of their country.|
|Is there anything you find confusing?|I'm not sure what the y-axis is representing in terms of units. Is it percentages or rates?|
|Is there anything you would change or do differently?|I noticed that the rates of growth are different for each income level, so it would be interesting if you could represent that in some way.|

Synthesis: 
I learned that my visualization conveyed the story I wanted to tell, but there were a few details I could add that would make it even more affective for the reader's interpretation of the data. I would edit my y-axis label to indicate the units being used and also try to include a way to represent the rates of change for each line. 


## Step Five: Build the Solution

Data source: World Bank (2024); van Zanden, J. et al. (2014) 

The visualization presented above follows a critique of the original visualization, a sketch, student critique, and redesign. For my final redesign, I have changed the y-axis label to indicate that the units are a percentage share of the population. I have also incorporated a brief description below the title stating the main takeaways and rates of change, as well as how the data source defined "literate". I selected the original version of this data visualization because the story they were trying to convey is important for readers to understand, however, the story was not easy to decipher upon first glance. By redesigning the visualization to a line graph highlighting the differences in literacy based on country income levels, the audience is still able to receive the same level of information in a more simplistic format.
